# Introduction

Congratulations, you just completed you Maritime 101 and is now ready to start your new **ocean empire**!

The first thing you do is spend your life savings buying a (_very_) used vessel. You then spend the next few months fixing it up and getting it ready for your first voyage. You are now ready to set sail!
But the ship and the repair means that you are already out of money, so you can not afford to hire on a crew.

**Not to worry**; you once fixed your VCR with only minor electrical burns, so setting up a ship for remote control should be a piece of cake.

But remote controlling it requires a connection, and maritime connectivity is expensive. You have to find a way to control the ship from onboard the ship itself, you need a **bot**!

Luckily you have extensive knowladge in Excel macros, so you are just the right person for the job - **Good luck!**
