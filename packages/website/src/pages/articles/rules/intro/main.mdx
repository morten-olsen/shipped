# The game

_Shipped_ is a game where you build bots, which controls vessels on the sea, battling for supremacy. You win by making the bot which can earn the most money, in the shortest amount of time, emitting the least CO2.

## The rules

The game is played in a succession of rounds. In each round your bot is giving information about the vessel, and the world around it. Based on this information, your bot must decide what to do next.

Bots can perform a multitude of actions, for instance:

### Anywhere
- Create a planned route for the vessel to follow
- Change the speed of the vessel

### At ports
- Fuel the vessel
- Buy goods 
- Sell goods 

## Scoring

The exact score calulation is TBD but will be a combination of profit and CO2 emissions.
